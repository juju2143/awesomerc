Juju's awesomewm configuration
==============================

This repo contains my rc.lua along with two of the themes I made, namely 
Princess Luna and Pinkie Pie (based on arch theme). Includes a 
conky-style status bar, a quake-style terminal accessible with Mod4-Z 
and quite a few other enhancements. Made for Arch Linux, but I guess it 
works for any distro. Feel free to modify it to match your config and 
your likings!

Dependencies and requirements
-----------------------------
- Awesome 3.5
- Silkscreen font (optional)
- xdg_menu command
- vicious lua library
- freedesktop lua library

If you use Arch Linux, pretty much all of them are in the repos and the AUR.
