Juju's awesomewm configuration
==============================

This repo contains my rc.lua along with two of the themes I made, namely 
Princess Luna (based on default theme) and Pinkie Pie (based on arch 
theme). Includes a conky-style status bar, a quake-style terminal 
accessible with Mod4-Z and quite a few other enhancements. Made for Arch 
Linux, but I guess it works for any distro. Feel free to modify it to 
match your config and your likings!

Dependencies and requirements
-----------------------------
- Awesome 3.5
- Silkscreen font (optional)
- xdg_menu command
- vicious lua library
- freedesktop lua library

If you use Arch Linux, pretty much all of them are in the repos and the AUR.
